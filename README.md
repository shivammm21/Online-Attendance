<h1>Online Attendance System</h1>

*** 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to our Online Attendance System project! 
This web-based solution is designed to streamline and 
automate the attendance tracking process for both teachers 
and students. The system allows teachers to generate a 
secure 4-digit OTP (One-Time Password) that students can 
use to mark their attendance.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
1. OTP-Based Attendance:
<ul>
    <li>Teachers can generate a 4-digit OTP for each class session.</li>
    <li>Students are required to enter the OTP within a 15-second window on 
    the web platform or through the dedicated mobile app.</li>
</ul>

2. Real-Time Attendance Tracking:
<ul>
    <li>Attendance records are updated in real-time as students 
    successfully enter the correct OTP.</li>
</ul>
3. Automated Absence Recording:
<ul>
    <li>If the OTP is not entered within the 15-second timeframe, 
    the system marks the student as absent.</li>
</ul>
4. PDF Attendance Reports:
<ul>
    <li>Teachers have the ability to download a PDF format list of present 
students at any time, providing a convenient way to manage attendance records.</li>
</ul>
5. Mobile App Integration:
<ul>
    <li>We have developed a mobile app for students, enabling them to easily and 
quickly enter the OTP from their smartphones.</li>
</ul>
