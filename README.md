# Online-Attendance
 Our project, Online Attendance, revolutionizes traditional attendance tracking methods by introducing a streamlined and efficient system accessible to both teachers and students. Through a user-friendly web interface and a dedicated mobile app, teachers can effortlessly generate secure 4-digit OTPs for each class session. Students then have a 15-second window to input the OTP, with real-time attendance updates and automated absence recording. Additionally, teachers have the convenience of downloading PDF reports of present students at any time. With our solution, attendance management becomes seamless, saving time and enhancing overall productivity for educational institutions.
